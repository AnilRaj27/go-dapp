# Interaction with Ethereum Smart Contracts using Go Application (geth)

Developed a Todolist smart contract in solidity and the development environment used is hardhat, deployed to rinkeby network by using infura API and infrastructure. Using `solc` solidity compiler generated `abi` and `bin` file and using  `abigen` generated the `.go` from the Todo solidity contract.
Also, written a go application which uses go ethereum packages and go bindings and interacts with the deployed smart contract via ethclient.
